# ERCA Environmental ROS Car Assistant
Software which helps you to automatize things on the car by simple voice recognising of commands. 
Preventing the pilot to loss the attention of the road.
The idea is to catch orders using Google Speech Recognition, and treat them with Robot Operating System (ROS),
allowing us to add functionalities as modules connected to a master node.
